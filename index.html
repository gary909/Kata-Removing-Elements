    <h1>Kata: Removing Elements</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>
    <p>
      Take an array and remove every second element from the array. <br />
      Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.<br />
      <br />
      Example:<br />
      <br />
      ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep",
      "Keep", ...]<br />
      <br />
      None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about
      that!<br />
